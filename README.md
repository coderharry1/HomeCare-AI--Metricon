Every day, construction support teams face the same problem:

1. Homeowners send angry, informal complaints
2. Agents spend hours rewriting them into formal records  
3. High-risk issues get missed and escalate into claims
4. No visibility into customer frustration levels

HomeCare-AI solves all four problems in seconds:

1. Converts informal chats into professional resolution notes
2. Detects emotional tone with confidence scoring
3. Flags frustrated customers for immediate escalation
4. Recommends the right action automatically

Result: Faster response times, better documentation, 
zero missed escalations.
